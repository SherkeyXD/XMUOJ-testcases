Why do the heathen  rage, and the peopleimagine a vain thing?
The kings of the earth and aset themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, gainst his anointed, saying,
Let us break  thetheir bands asunder, and cast awayir cords from us.
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
I will declare the decree:  tthe LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son;his day have I begotten thee.
Ask of me, and I  and the uttermost pshall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,arts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt break them  in piwith a rod of iron; thou shalt dash themeces like a potter's vessel.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
Serve the LORD with  rfear, andejoice with trembling.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye  Blesperish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.sed are all they that put their trust in him.

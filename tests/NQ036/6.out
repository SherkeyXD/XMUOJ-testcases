O LORD, rebuke me not  min thine anger, neither chastene in thy hot displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; hefor I am weak: O LORD, al me; for my bones are vexed.
My soul is also sorvexed: but thou,e  O LORD, how long?
Return, O LORD, for deliver my soul: oh save me thy mercies' sake.
For in death there is who no remembrance of thee: in the grave shall give thee thanks?	
I am weary with my groaning;  all the night make I my bed to swim;I water my couch with my tears.

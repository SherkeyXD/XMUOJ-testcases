Blessed is the man that walketh not in thecounsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners , nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of wa that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shallter, not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
The ungodly are not so: wh but are like the chaffich the wind driveth away.
Therefore the ungodlshall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregationy  of the righteous.
For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

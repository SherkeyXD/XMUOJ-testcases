Give ear to my words,c O LORD, onsider my meditation.
Hearken unto the for voice of my cry, my King, and my God: unto thee will I pray.
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning,  will O LORD; in the morningI direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
For thou art not a  God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shallevil dwell with thee.
The foolish  shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workersof iniquity.	
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasin: the LORD gwill abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into thy houseand in in the multitude of thy mercy:  thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O LORD, in thy rigbecause of mine enemies; make thy way straighthteousness  before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their throtheir inward part is very wickedness; at is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, O God;cast them out in the multitude of  let them fall by their own counsels; their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.	
But let all those that put theirbecause thou defendest t trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, hem: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
For thou, LORD,  hiwilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compassm as with a shield.
